    <h2>Why Should I Adopt a Cat?</h2>
    <p>According to Research Gate, owning a cat, or any pet you adopt from a shelter, has been shown to have positive effects on humans’ ability to cope with stress,       anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Taking a cat home from a shelter       can improve your sense of happiness and general well-being. Cats in many shelters         interact with their caretakers and volunteers every day, and these people really get to know their personalities. Particularly with adult cats, you can     find a      companion with the type of temperament you’re looking for. You could find a playful, active cat or a calmer feline who prefers cuddling and a quieter         environment.</p>

    <p>You can find any type of cat you want at a shelter, from kittens to seniors, short-haired to long-haired, all sizes and colors. In fact, if you’re looking for a     specific breed, such as a Siamese, you can contact cat-specific         rescue groups to find your new friend. If you have another cat, or a cat-friendly dog,         bringing another cat home from a shelter can help reduce feelings of loneliness during the day when you’re out. Of course, you will want to ask        the shelter      to help you “cat test” your dog, and if you have a cat, expect a period of adjustment before the new and current cats feel comfortable together.</p>

    <p>Cats, particularly older, calmer cats, can provide loving companionship to older adults. They’re easy to care for, and you can find one at a shelter that         matches your lifestyle with some helpful advice from the shelter staff and       volunteers.</p>
